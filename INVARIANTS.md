# Invariants for changes to the circuit

This page is for you if you change `qec/` to make the circuit cheaper. It says what `scripts/accept.py` protects and why, what no script can check for you, and how to hand a change back.

A live board tests uploads, and its benchmark source is not public yet. `accept.py` encodes the invariants that the circuit must keep under any scoring rule we expect. A change can pass the gate and still be refused or fail on the board, because the gate does not compute the charge or run the board's test. Nothing here is a promise about the final scoring.

## Run the gate

```sh
python3 scripts/accept.py --quick   # about 80 s of CPU, 9 addends built, the 256-bit upload simulated at 2 of them
python3 scripts/accept.py           # about 600 s of CPU, 24 addends built and simulated, plus the flat 256-bit circuit at G
```

The CPU times are user plus system time over the gate and its checker processes, measured with Python 3.14 on an Apple M4. The checkers run as parallel processes, so wall time depends on the cores and on the load from other work. With 10 cores at load average 6 to 15, quick mode took 17 s and full mode 103 s. A reviewer measured full mode at 298 s with load average 93 on the same 10 cores. On fewer free cores the wall time grows toward the CPU totals. Full mode peaks near 4.5 GB of memory across its processes. Python is stdlib only. The gate prints one row per check and writes the full evidence to `verify-out/accept.json`. It exits 0 only when no check fails. A check marked pending waits on the published benchmark and fails nothing.

Run `--quick` while you iterate and the full mode before you hand a change back. `--only I5 I6` runs a subset. `--sample N` and `--seed S` change the random addends that I1, I3, I5, I6 and I7 build and that `I2.secp` simulates. A row's seconds are the time the gate waited for it, so the first row that needs the addends carries their build time.

## What each check protects

The circuit implements |c>|R>|0> -> |c>|R + c*A>|0> for a fixed public point A on secp256k1, under the frozen profile `secp256k1-controlled-exact-v1`. Every check below guards one part of that contract or one limit of the benchmark.

**I1 interface.** The control is wire 0, x is wires 1..n, and y is wires n+1..2n, at n = 7 and at n = 256, for G and for every built addend. Every other wire is scratch, and the wire count stays at most 4,096. The benchmark reads the declared registers from these positions, so a reordered layout computes the right sum in the wrong place. The reference uses 2,311 wires.

**I2 exactness.** The profile requires an exact unitary, so the circuit must be right on every input, including infinity and R in {A, -A, -2A}. I2 runs the existing checkers and parses what they print. It does not reimplement them.

- `I2.model` runs `scripts/model_check.py`. At 13 small primes it traces the Euclid loop for every x, against the proven iteration bound and the width schedule. It checks the classical multiplier model on every (x, y) below q = 300 and on 8 sampled y per x above, so the multiplier part is not exhaustive.
- `I2.toy` runs `scripts/check.py` on 36 toy instances of 4 to 10 bits, two addends on each of 18 curves. It simulates every point with c = 0 and c = 1 at gate level and requires all scratch back at zero. The gate lists the 36 (curve, addend) pairs itself and requires each exactly once, with 2 x (curve order) lanes. It also loads the flat toy file `scripts/emit.py` wrote, `toy127_circuit.json`, and simulates it the same way at the addend the gate asked for.
- `I2.toy-hier` runs the same check on the hierarchical emission. `check.py` parses the JSON text with `qec/flatten.py` and expands every call through its wire map and inverse flag, as the benchmark would. On each toy instance it also compares that expansion with the text `flatten.operations_json` writes. It then simulates the hierarchical toy file `scripts/emit.py` wrote, `toy127_circuit.hier.json`. The upload is hierarchical, so a broken call map would pass `I2.toy` and still upload a wrong circuit.
- `I2.components` runs `scripts/component_check.py`. It checks the 256-bit adders, doubler, negation and multiplier on boundary inputs near q and 2^256 that random points almost never reach.
- `I2.mutation` runs `scripts/mutation_control.py`. It confirms that the checker still rejects mutated circuits. At its fixed seed the reference catches 163 of 200 CCX-to-CX demotions, and the rest are equivalent circuits. The check fails below 163.
- `I2.secp` simulates the 256-bit hierarchical upload, expanded the same way as `I2.toy-hier`. Each addend runs on infinity, A, -A, -2A, 2A, 3A and random R, with c = 0 and c = 1. Quick mode runs G and one random addend with 8 random R. Full mode runs every built addend with 120 random R. It also requires that the JSON it simulated for G is the bytes `scripts/emit.py` writes.
- `I2.secp-flat` runs only in full mode. It checks the flat 256-bit circuit at A = G on the same points with 120 random R, and requires all 252 lanes.

Each checker must reach the coverage pinned in `COVERAGE` at the top of `scripts/accept.py`: 13 model primes, 36 toy instances and 25,800 lanes, each listed instance exactly once, 49 components and 8,951 lanes, 200 mutation trials, and 2 x (6 + random R) lanes per simulated addend. A receipt that covers less fails, even with zero failures.

**I3 gate set.** Every emitted primitive is X, CX, CCX or SWAP, with no measurement and no reset. The profile disables measurement cleanup, and a circuit of these four gates is a permutation with no phases. That is why basis-state exactness with clean scratch gives the exact unitary on superpositions. A single Z, CZ or measurement breaks that argument even when every basis check passes. I3 reads the emitted JSON at toy and 256-bit sizes and the JSON of every built addend, and counts the gate kinds in every toy instance and every expanded 256-bit upload.

**I5 addend independence of definitions.** The gate builds the 256-bit kernel hierarchically for [1]G to [8]G and the seeded random addends, 1 of them in quick mode and 16 in full mode. Every definition must be identical across them. The gate compares the sha256 of each definition after it parses the JSON and writes it back compactly, so whitespace in the file does not count. Key order does, because the digest keeps the order the file uses. Today all 261 definitions are identical, and A enters only through the top level, in the `cmodadd_const` calls in `_kernel` and the four exception compares and loads in `build` (`qec/point_add.py:110-190`). Keep it that way. A whole attack runs this kernel for many addends, and shared definitions let one upload of the expensive parts serve every addend.

**I6 cost at G and sample statistics.** I6 reports CCX, T = 7 x CCX, ops and wires at G. Over the addends the gate built, [1]G to [8]G and a seeded random sample, it reports the sample maximum and the sample minimum. These are statistics of that sample, not bounds. I6 shows the sample maximum T against the reference, 50,465,989, the largest T any sampled addend reached at commit `8ca9b0e`. I6 never fails on cost. It fails only when its counts disagree with the expanded upload that `I2.secp` simulated, at every simulated addend, or with the flat circuit at toy size and, in full mode, at G.

**I7 limits.** Wires stay at most 4,096. The hierarchical JSON for G, which the gate writes to `verify-out/accept/emit/`, stays under 104,857,600 bytes, and so does the JSON for every built addend. Every built addend also stays at most 4,096 wires. The reference is 43,422,940 bytes.

**I7.charge.** The live board charges a hierarchical upload against a limit of 21,696,718. The charge is the expanded ops, plus about 64 per call and about 0.84 per call wire. Calls and call wires count over the expanded circuit, so a call inside a definition counts once each time that definition runs. The reference is charged 20,960,620, which leaves 736,098. An upload over the limit comes back `REJECTED` with `StructuralCapExceeded`. The gate does not compute the charge, so this check stays pending. The older limit and charge that `verify-out/accept.json` records for this check do not apply to the board. Before you upload, check your charge with `qcheck.py` from the member guide.

**R1 run hygiene.** The gate records every tracked file and every untracked file git does not ignore, before and after it runs. For each path it records the file type, the permission bits and a hash of the contents, or of the link target for a symlink, without following links. Every checker writes under `verify-out/`, so a run that changes one of those files is a bug in the gate. It compares these records, not git status, so a second edit to a file you already changed still shows, and so do a lost executable bit and a file replaced by a symlink.

## What no script can check

**One generator for every curve.** The exhaustive toy check says something about 256 bits only because the same code emits both sizes. Only the constants and the bound-derived width schedule differ. A code path that runs only at n = 256, or only for secp256k1's q, escapes every exhaustive check. One mutation used to test this gate added 2.8 million identity gates only when n = 256. It passed all of I2 and was caught only by the upload limit. A wrong gate that runs only at n = 256 fails `I2.secp`, which simulates the 256-bit upload in both modes, but only on the points and addends it samples. Write size-generic code. If a trick needs a property of secp256k1's q, test that property on toy primes that share it, or prove it.

**The iteration bound is proven, not sampled.** The Euclid loop runs bitlen(q(q-1)) = 512 iterations at secp256k1 because u*v at least halves per step. Random inputs finish far earlier. The paper's approximate circuits use a shorter count and fail on rare inputs. Shrinking the bound needs a proof that covers every input, not a sample that passed.

**Random 256-bit sampling cannot tell exact from approximate.** Most CCX in the constant adders and the idle Euclid tails fire only on rare carries. A circuit that drops them passes random 256-bit lanes and is still wrong (README, exactness evidence item 5). Exactness rests on the exhaustive toy check, the 256-bit boundary components and the proven bound. A passing `I2.secp` alone proves little.

## Where the CCX are

At A = G the circuit has 7,209,419 CCX.

| Part | CCX | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Two dialog multipliers, 3,140,864 each | 6,281,728 | 87.1% |
| Lambda-squared subtract | 910,080 | 12.6% |
| Flags, exception loads, constant adds | 17,611 | 0.2% |

The multipliers and the lambda-squared subtract hold 99.8% of the CCX, and none of them reads A. Spend your effort there. That work also carries over to a future windowed kernel that takes the addend as a quantum input, because that kernel needs the same multiplier and subtract. Constant-adder tricks do not carry over, since a windowed kernel has no classical constant to exploit. They also act on the 0.2% that depends on A.

## Report cost over a sample of addends

Cost depends on A. [2]G and [3]G each cost 7,209,427 CCX, 8 more than G. Over 1,024 sampled addends at the reference, T ranged from 50,465,177 to 50,465,989. The live board tests A = G. A later benchmark may test any addend, and a whole attack runs hundreds of them.

The sample maximum that I6 prints is the largest cost among the addends the gate built. It does not bound the cost at other addends. The true maximum over every A is unproven. A change can raise the cost at an addend outside the sample, and the gate will not see it. So keep the cost of your change independent of A. A change inside the definitions does that, because I5 holds them identical across addends. If your change touches the top level, where A enters, argue its maximum over every A. A change that helps G and hurts another addend is a regression. Quote the I6 sample maximum with the sample it came from, not the cost at G.

## Don't trade ops for many small calls

The live board charges per call and per call wire on top of the expanded ops. Splitting the circuit into many small definitions or many calls can lower the op count and still raise the charge. Calls and call wires add 1,965,159 to the reference's charge, about 87% of it from call wires, and the room left is about 3.4% of the limit. Prefer changes that remove CCX and ops outright.

## Not settled yet

- The official scoring rule and caps. The live board's costs are raw per-call counts, and the board qualifies nothing.
- Which whole-attack route comes first. One candidate is the binary wrapper with 512 controlled additions of fixed points. The other is a windowed kernel with a coherent addend.

## Hand a change back

To enter a circuit on the board, follow the pull request format in your member guide. To hand back a change to the generator, open a pull request against this repository with:

1. The change, with nothing under `receipts/` edited by hand.
2. The output of `python3 scripts/accept.py` in full mode, pasted into the description, and its `verify-out/accept.json` attached.
3. The I6 sample maximum T, the sample it came from, and its delta against 50,465,989. For a change to the top level, add the argument for its maximum over every A.
4. For any change to the iteration bound, the width schedule or a modular reduction, the argument that it stays exact on every input.

Standalone M is checked only on x in [1,q), with exactly six x=0 component lanes excluded (57 to 51; total 8951 to 8945); nonzero kernel entries rely on its flag code. ab-godder’s PR #29 source at 61e0c50 fails those six excluded lanes in its unnarrowed component check. This narrowing does not establish the zero-input convention.


The constant-tree filter adds I2.filter and I2.filter-small to the existing gate census.
Their normal blocks must preserve every output and clean scratch, and the wrong-zero controls must be detected.
LIVE_FILTER off must reproduce the preceding emitted bytes; the full gate retains I2.secp-flat and pending I7.charge.

The secp256k1 width cut is ab-godder’s PR #28 argument and schedule. The standalone multiplier promise and zero-caller limitation remain. Setting SECP256K1_CUT_LAST=-1 must restore the preceding emission exactly.
