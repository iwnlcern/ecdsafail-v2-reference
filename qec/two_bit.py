"""The four-symbol tick on a held offset, g = [g0, b].

    g0 = 1:         S = 2S + R mod q, then swap R and S on b
    g0 = 0, b = 0:  S = 2S mod q
    g0 = 0, b = 1:  S = 4S mod q

docs/mux-proof.md states and proves what follows. Credit: the offset
T = S + R between a doubling and the following subtract is the representation of section VI of
arXiv:2609.05625. The tick below keeps that offset as an unreduced integer, so nothing in it is
negative.

After the sweep in point_add.py, every B1 is followed by a subtract or ends the pass. A B1 then
adds R and does no reduction, leaving H = 2T + R, and the subtract after it makes 2H - R = 4T + R.

Add and shift now have complementary controls, so one rolling XOR wire D, the sum of the x lines
so far, lets one CCX carry both: a pair of neighbouring word bits takes D, or on J its own XOR.

H's bit 0 is R's, so it is not stored. On a B1 its wire and the next cell's g0, which must be 1,
hold H's two top bits between the ticks, and nothing clean is held across them.
